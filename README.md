This app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory using MySQL.

INSTRUCTIONS
1) Open bamazonCustomer.js file. On line 8, enter your MySQL password. Then, in your Visual Studio Code terminal, and run node bamazonCustomer.js (see terminal.png in the assets folder as an example).
2) Once node is running, the terminal will prompt you to enter a product ID (i.e. 1-10 in order listed in the MySQL database). 
3) After you've selected a the product ID, it will ask you how many units you would like.
4) The terminal will then tell you how many items you purchased and the total cost.
5) The MYSQL database will update (see mysqlworkbench.png in the assets folder for example).
